# UserLookupHelper

## Introduction

The UserLookupHelper is a versatile utility class designed to assist with user data retrieval and management. It simplifies interactions with user data, making it easier to fetch and use user information.

> **Note:** By default, the UserLookupHelper is designed to interact with and modify complete ISVA user entries that have an associated ISVA account entry in the SecAuthority tree. To support basic users, you must utilize the ISVA RTE. For comprehensive instructions on setting up the ISAM RTE with basic users, please refer to the following guide: [The Correct Way to Set Up the ISAM RTE with Basic Users](https://www.gwbasics.be/2019/08/the-only-correct-way-to-setup-the-isam-rte-with-basic-users.html)
